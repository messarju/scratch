1
00:00:24,712 --> 00:00:31,052
Settsu Mine, Hyogo
1878 (Meiji Era 11)

2
00:01:02,959 --> 00:01:05,044
You're really sure he's here?

3
00:01:05,044 --> 00:01:08,631
We've been watching for two months.
There's no mistake.

4
00:01:09,632 --> 00:01:11,384
Let's end this here.

5
00:02:03,019 --> 00:02:04,437
Be very careful.

6
00:02:15,323 --> 00:02:16,574
Over here!

7
00:02:53,903 --> 00:02:55,321
Who are you?

8
00:02:55,321 --> 00:02:56,322
Halt!

9
00:03:59,469 --> 00:04:03,598
Do you believe in hell?

10
00:04:09,645 --> 00:04:12,440
Surely a world like this, awash in blood,

11
00:04:14,233 --> 00:04:16,819
deserves the name hell.

12
00:04:35,713 --> 00:04:37,882
Are you Makoto Shishio?

13
00:04:39,509 --> 00:04:41,177
What if I am?

14
00:04:44,722 --> 00:04:46,057
You know damn well!

15
00:04:46,057 --> 00:04:47,308
Uh-uh.

16
00:04:49,519 --> 00:04:51,979
Don't move from there.

17
00:04:54,065 --> 00:04:56,526
I love that sound!

18
00:04:57,235 --> 00:04:59,237
You bastard!

19
00:04:59,237 --> 00:05:02,406
Why do you think I knew you were coming?

20
00:05:07,537 --> 00:05:11,415
Hajime Saito of the Shogun's
Shinsengumi police.

21
00:05:13,543 --> 00:05:15,002
A traitor...

22
00:05:15,545 --> 00:05:18,422
We both remember the Bakumatsu.

23
00:05:19,090 --> 00:05:22,426
Are you content with
what this world has become?

24
00:05:23,094 --> 00:05:27,014
Take off that new-government uniform.

25
00:05:27,765 --> 00:05:29,684
Come and join us.

26
00:05:30,309 --> 00:05:34,689
We will turn the clock back
to those days of upheaval.

27
00:05:36,107 --> 00:05:38,442
I take orders from no one.

28
00:05:39,110 --> 00:05:40,695
No?

29
00:05:42,280 --> 00:05:44,198
Very well.

30
00:05:55,334 --> 00:05:56,752
Shishio!

31
00:06:16,772 --> 00:06:18,649
Man is born to carnage.

32
00:06:19,901 --> 00:06:21,736
This world itself is hell.

33
00:06:21,736 --> 00:06:22,945
Shishio!

34
00:07:08,199 --> 00:07:14,121
RUROUNI KENSHIN: KYOTO INFERNO

35
00:07:19,752 --> 00:07:24,048
Kyoto is in chaos!

36
00:07:24,048 --> 00:07:26,926
What do the Shogun's police
think they're doing?

37
00:07:26,926 --> 00:07:28,594
Indeed!

38
00:07:28,594 --> 00:07:33,265
At least they shouldn't be
adding to the trouble!

39
00:07:33,265 --> 00:07:34,976
Onward.

40
00:07:37,228 --> 00:07:38,229
Who's that?

41
00:07:39,563 --> 00:07:41,941
Here he comes!

42
00:07:47,363 --> 00:07:48,990
Who are you?

43
00:07:50,116 --> 00:07:51,659
That scar!

44
00:07:52,576 --> 00:07:57,498
My name is not one worth stating.

45
00:07:58,791 --> 00:08:03,170
I walk the streets of Kyoto,
dreaming of a new age

46
00:08:03,170 --> 00:08:06,424
when the Emperor reigns supreme.

47
00:08:06,424 --> 00:08:08,509
Bakkyusai the Killer.

48
00:08:11,262 --> 00:08:14,181
I am he!

49
00:08:18,269 --> 00:08:19,729
What nerve!

50
00:08:19,729 --> 00:08:21,856
We will cut you down!

51
00:08:21,856 --> 00:08:23,149
Have at him!

52
00:08:25,109 --> 00:08:27,570
Why is Battosai the villain?

53
00:08:27,570 --> 00:08:31,115
"Bakkyusai", not "Battosai."

54
00:08:31,115 --> 00:08:32,408
Bakkyusai?

55
00:08:52,845 --> 00:08:53,846
Hang in there!

56
00:09:04,815 --> 00:09:11,072
Asakusa, Tokyo

57
00:09:27,588 --> 00:09:31,509
You're an old legend now, "Battosai."

58
00:10:00,788 --> 00:10:04,166
Invigorate the Heart

59
00:10:10,297 --> 00:10:12,174
Step in!

60
00:10:18,472 --> 00:10:19,849
Hit him first!

61
00:10:22,893 --> 00:10:24,311
Watch him!

62
00:10:24,311 --> 00:10:25,396
Harder!

63
00:10:27,481 --> 00:10:28,899
Shout out!

64
00:10:44,039 --> 00:10:45,666
We have returned.

65
00:10:45,666 --> 00:10:47,585
We're back!

66
00:10:48,586 --> 00:10:49,670
Hello.

67
00:10:49,670 --> 00:10:51,088
Sensei!

68
00:10:53,382 --> 00:10:55,718
Why won't you teach us?

69
00:10:55,718 --> 00:10:57,887
You're why we came here!

70
00:10:57,887 --> 00:10:59,388
Please!

71
00:10:59,388 --> 00:11:03,184
You're mistaken.
I am merely a guest here.

72
00:11:03,184 --> 00:11:05,519
I am no master of fencing.

73
00:11:05,519 --> 00:11:06,729
But...

74
00:11:08,022 --> 00:11:10,107
The way of the sword has changed.

75
00:11:10,858 --> 00:11:14,778
The motto of the Kamiya Dojo
is "invigorate the heart."

76
00:11:15,529 --> 00:11:19,450
In this new age,
that is what the sword must teach you.

77
00:11:21,285 --> 00:11:25,873
If it's a fight you want,
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's your man!

78
00:11:25,873 --> 00:11:27,458
I don't charge much.

79
00:11:28,626 --> 00:11:29,710
Well?

80
00:11:29,710 --> 00:11:31,545
What do you say?

81
00:11:31,545 --> 00:11:34,048
You want to fight?

82
00:11:34,048 --> 00:11:36,967
Why not show them some stuff?

83
00:11:38,219 --> 00:11:43,140
These days of peace have no need
for my High Heaven style.

84
00:11:43,641 --> 00:11:44,892
Kenshin!

85
00:11:44,892 --> 00:11:45,976
Miss Megumi!

86
00:11:45,976 --> 00:11:49,230
How's the clinic?
Business good?

87
00:11:49,230 --> 00:11:53,108
Doctors don't talk about
"good business," you oaf!

88
00:11:53,108 --> 00:11:54,944
I'll get dinner ready.

89
00:11:54,944 --> 00:11:56,987
Wait. You have visitors.

90
00:12:01,575 --> 00:12:03,327
You're Mr. Himura?

91
00:12:04,328 --> 00:12:06,121
What would you like?

92
00:12:06,121 --> 00:12:08,332
I'm Superintendent Kawaji.

93
00:12:08,332 --> 00:12:13,254
Someone wishes to talk with you.
Would you come with me?

94
00:12:13,254 --> 00:12:17,758
Hey! We're just getting ready
for dinner here.

95
00:12:17,758 --> 00:12:21,178
Who sent you to come
waltzing in here like this?

96
00:12:21,804 --> 00:12:25,349
Toshimichi Okubo, the Home Minister.

97
00:12:25,349 --> 00:12:26,976
Who's that?

98
00:12:26,976 --> 00:12:29,853
The top man in the government, that's who.

99
00:12:33,357 --> 00:12:36,151
Don't go. It'll just be trouble.

100
00:12:37,152 --> 00:12:38,195
Hey...

101
00:12:39,947 --> 00:12:42,324
If he goes, I come with him.

102
00:12:43,033 --> 00:12:46,161
I don't trust you guys
in the new government.

103
00:12:51,625 --> 00:12:52,876
Fine.

104
00:12:52,876 --> 00:12:54,378
Come with us.

105
00:12:59,383 --> 00:13:01,176
I won't be long.

106
00:13:10,978 --> 00:13:14,690
Home Ministry

107
00:13:17,526 --> 00:13:18,694
Excuse us.

108
00:13:28,287 --> 00:13:31,665
It's been a long time, Mr. Okubo.

109
00:13:32,333 --> 00:13:35,210
At last we meet again.

110
00:13:35,961 --> 00:13:37,379
You know him?

111
00:13:39,715 --> 00:13:41,842
I'll come straight to the point.

112
00:13:44,053 --> 00:13:45,429
What is it?

113
00:13:48,390 --> 00:13:50,934
Shishio is plotting in Kyoto.

114
00:13:51,977 --> 00:13:54,730
Shishio? Who's that?

115
00:13:54,730 --> 00:13:58,317
Another assassin.

116
00:13:58,317 --> 00:13:59,568
What?

117
00:13:59,568 --> 00:14:03,197
The successor to Battosai the Killer.

118
00:14:05,657 --> 00:14:10,037
When you laid down your sword
at the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,

119
00:14:10,537 --> 00:14:14,124
he was fighting there, too.

120
00:14:15,376 --> 00:14:18,837
He was one of our assassins.

121
00:14:34,770 --> 00:14:40,401
In speed, skills, and quick thinking,
he was a match for you.

122
00:14:41,527 --> 00:14:44,738
However, unlike you,

123
00:14:44,738 --> 00:14:50,786
he cared nothing for the weak,
or for those with him.

124
00:14:50,786 --> 00:14:52,496
Victory!

125
00:14:53,080 --> 00:14:55,124
It's the Emperor's banner!

126
00:15:00,129 --> 00:15:02,339
We've won!

127
00:15:11,640 --> 00:15:13,809
Ruthless ambition.

128
00:15:13,809 --> 00:15:19,940
A wish to rule for which
he will trample over anyone.

129
00:15:20,524 --> 00:15:22,985
That's Shishio.

130
00:15:25,946 --> 00:15:28,615
I've won!

131
00:15:41,462 --> 00:15:43,964
Well done!

132
00:15:43,964 --> 00:15:45,674
We won!

133
00:15:45,674 --> 00:15:46,967
Thanks to you!

134
00:15:47,843 --> 00:15:49,636
You did it!

135
00:15:49,636 --> 00:15:50,804
Well done!

136
00:15:54,850 --> 00:15:57,394
You bastards!

137
00:16:04,485 --> 00:16:06,153
Bastards!

138
00:16:12,993 --> 00:16:15,704
You bastards!

139
00:16:16,497 --> 00:16:19,166
Some of his assassinations were so brutal

140
00:16:19,166 --> 00:16:23,253
they would have brought discredit
on the new government.

141
00:16:24,296 --> 00:16:26,423
We had to eliminate him.

142
00:16:28,342 --> 00:16:32,513
You put down your sword,
and his body was burned.

143
00:17:01,416 --> 00:17:06,880
He should have died, but then it snowed...

144
00:18:20,787 --> 00:18:22,122
He's alive?

145
00:18:22,122 --> 00:18:26,126
He disappeared into the Kyoto underworld.

146
00:18:26,793 --> 00:18:31,882
He's taken in a bunch of
bloodthirsty mercenaries

147
00:18:31,882 --> 00:18:34,301
and formed his own private army.

148
00:18:34,301 --> 00:18:36,637
He has one aim in mind,

149
00:18:39,306 --> 00:18:42,059
to overthrow the new government.

150
00:18:44,227 --> 00:18:45,979
Wait a minute!

151
00:18:45,979 --> 00:18:50,734
He hates the government for a reason.
Why drag Kenshin into this?

152
00:18:50,734 --> 00:18:55,072
He's destroyed every force
we've sent against him!

153
00:18:58,742 --> 00:19:00,702
The only one we can turn to

154
00:19:01,745 --> 00:19:03,080
is you.

155
00:19:07,250 --> 00:19:08,543
Mr. Okubo,

156
00:19:11,672 --> 00:19:13,590
you look worn out.

157
00:19:18,845 --> 00:19:21,264
Building the new age

158
00:19:22,766 --> 00:19:27,020
is much harder work
than destroying the old one.

159
00:19:27,020 --> 00:19:28,855
Enrich the country, strengthen the military

160
00:19:29,856 --> 00:19:34,611
I don't expect an immediate answer
to a request like this.

161
00:19:36,279 --> 00:19:39,616
Will you take a week and think about it?

162
00:19:41,284 --> 00:19:44,788
So, on May 14th, one week from today,

163
00:19:47,624 --> 00:19:49,418
I hope you'll say yes.

164
00:19:56,425 --> 00:19:58,218
That's crazy!

165
00:19:58,218 --> 00:20:01,304
They want Kenshin to assassinate him?

166
00:20:01,304 --> 00:20:02,973
It's not my idea!

167
00:20:04,307 --> 00:20:07,811
They want Kenshin to clean up the mess

168
00:20:07,811 --> 00:20:09,730
that they've made!

169
00:20:09,730 --> 00:20:10,772
Bastards!

170
00:20:11,773 --> 00:20:12,774
Not only that.

171
00:20:13,316 --> 00:20:17,612
You will, of course, be well-rewarded.

172
00:20:17,612 --> 00:20:22,117
And there are certain illegalities
we are prepared to overlook.

173
00:20:23,118 --> 00:20:24,578
For example,

174
00:20:24,578 --> 00:20:28,331
Megumi Takani's acquittal
on an opium charge.

175
00:20:28,331 --> 00:20:29,958
That's bullshit!

176
00:20:29,958 --> 00:20:34,629
If that's how they're pressuring him,
they can hang me first!

177
00:20:34,629 --> 00:20:36,590
Tell me about it!

178
00:20:40,343 --> 00:20:44,181
I won't let you go to Kyoto.

179
00:20:59,362 --> 00:21:02,866
Kioicho, Tokyo

180
00:21:02,866 --> 00:21:08,789
May 14

181
00:21:24,054 --> 00:21:29,184
Without Himura, the nation is lost.

182
00:22:05,887 --> 00:22:07,347
How do you do?

183
00:22:07,347 --> 00:22:08,348
What the...

184
00:22:12,060 --> 00:22:14,271
I have a message from Mr. Shishio.

185
00:22:14,896 --> 00:22:20,068
"If you're thinking of sending
Battosai Himura against me,

186
00:22:20,068 --> 00:22:21,444
"don't waste your time.

187
00:22:25,448 --> 00:22:27,450
"This land will be mine."

188
00:22:43,925 --> 00:22:47,095
There! Now it's clean.

189
00:22:47,095 --> 00:22:49,639
Is this the time for laundry?

190
00:22:50,807 --> 00:22:54,436
Tell them to take that job and shove it.

191
00:22:54,436 --> 00:22:57,981
You really hate
the new government, don't you?

192
00:22:58,607 --> 00:23:00,650
I hate people like that.

193
00:23:09,451 --> 00:23:10,660
Kenshin?

194
00:23:12,454 --> 00:23:14,831
I'm going to Mr. Okubo's now.

195
00:23:15,832 --> 00:23:18,835
Yahiko, will you hang these out?

196
00:23:22,964 --> 00:23:24,507
Maybe I'll come, too.

197
00:23:24,507 --> 00:23:28,345
No, it might get complicated.

198
00:23:28,845 --> 00:23:30,513
I'm best alone.

199
00:23:47,364 --> 00:23:50,700
He's chosen life as a wanderer
who never kills.

200
00:23:51,493 --> 00:23:53,995
He won't leave you and go to Kyoto.

201
00:23:57,958 --> 00:23:59,125
Here he comes.

202
00:24:00,210 --> 00:24:01,252
Let's go.

203
00:24:02,837 --> 00:24:05,006
Ichiro Shimada, samurai!

204
00:24:05,006 --> 00:24:06,841
Tsurahide Cho, samurai!

205
00:24:06,841 --> 00:24:08,134
Villains!

206
00:24:15,850 --> 00:24:18,728
Someone got here before us!

207
00:24:22,899 --> 00:24:24,693
Okubo!

208
00:24:41,876 --> 00:24:43,086
Mr. Okubo...

209
00:24:56,099 --> 00:24:58,768
There were men planning to assassinate him.

210
00:25:01,104 --> 00:25:03,273
We used that.

211
00:25:16,953 --> 00:25:19,289
Was he one of Shishio's men?

212
00:25:20,290 --> 00:25:22,959
This is how Shishio works!

213
00:25:24,461 --> 00:25:29,132
He wreaks havoc using what he learns
from spies he has everywhere.

214
00:25:29,132 --> 00:25:31,301
You never see his hand!

215
00:25:33,636 --> 00:25:35,638
He'll whittle away at us

216
00:25:36,473 --> 00:25:39,309
until the day he rises up.

217
00:25:45,315 --> 00:25:46,816
Come with me.

218
00:26:05,668 --> 00:26:06,836
Who are they?

219
00:26:09,005 --> 00:26:11,674
Officers Shishio killed.

220
00:26:14,344 --> 00:26:16,012
He's taunting us.

221
00:26:16,679 --> 00:26:22,018
He sent them last night,
as if to coincide with today.

222
00:27:27,417 --> 00:27:31,254
I will repeat Mr. Okubo's request.

223
00:27:32,255 --> 00:27:34,924
You are our only hope.

224
00:27:39,762 --> 00:27:42,432
Japan is about to lose its way.

225
00:27:43,933 --> 00:27:46,060
Shishio will seize his chance.

226
00:27:49,105 --> 00:27:50,273
It's war.

227
00:27:51,941 --> 00:27:53,276
See you in Kyoto.

228
00:28:10,627 --> 00:28:12,962
Extra! Extra!

229
00:28:12,962 --> 00:28:15,381
Lord Okubo assassinated!

230
00:28:15,882 --> 00:28:19,302
The Home Minister's been assassinated!

231
00:28:32,815 --> 00:28:37,654
Assassins Kill Home Minister Okubo!

232
00:28:49,290 --> 00:28:50,667
You're back.

233
00:28:51,501 --> 00:28:54,087
Shishio did that.

234
00:28:59,676 --> 00:29:05,181
We cannot let him go on.
I will go to Kyoto.

235
00:29:14,023 --> 00:29:15,692
To kill

236
00:29:18,695 --> 00:29:20,029
Shishio?

237
00:29:25,201 --> 00:29:26,869
Even when you found out

238
00:29:30,039 --> 00:29:33,209
I was Battosai the Killer,

239
00:29:33,710 --> 00:29:35,712
you let me stay at your dojo.

240
00:29:41,467 --> 00:29:42,677
That made me

241
00:29:44,887 --> 00:29:46,055
very happy.

242
00:29:51,728 --> 00:29:56,149
But to those who hate the likes of
Shishio or Battosai,

243
00:29:56,149 --> 00:29:59,068
Battosai is who I remain.

244
00:30:01,404 --> 00:30:02,905
But why?

245
00:30:04,991 --> 00:30:07,577
Why do you have to go?

246
00:30:08,161 --> 00:30:12,582
What do you care
if he hates the government?

247
00:30:14,083 --> 00:30:15,418
Stay here.

248
00:30:17,670 --> 00:30:23,509
Eat with us, practice with us, laugh with us.

249
00:30:24,427 --> 00:30:30,433
When I swore off killing,
Shishio took my place.

250
00:30:31,351 --> 00:30:33,728
It is my job to stop him.

251
00:30:40,234 --> 00:30:41,611
If you go,

252
00:30:44,781 --> 00:30:47,909
you might fall back into killing.

253
00:30:51,287 --> 00:30:53,289
No one can throw away

254
00:30:55,416 --> 00:30:57,126
his past.

255
00:31:09,472 --> 00:31:11,307
Thank you

256
00:31:12,809 --> 00:31:17,313
and goodbye.

257
00:31:20,441 --> 00:31:21,984
Once again,

258
00:31:24,112 --> 00:31:26,322
I will be a wanderer.

259
00:31:57,478 --> 00:31:59,355
That son of a bitch!

260
00:32:00,148 --> 00:32:01,482
Damn him!

261
00:32:01,482 --> 00:32:02,525
I'll help.

262
00:32:03,985 --> 00:32:07,864
He took off alone and left me!

263
00:32:08,656 --> 00:32:10,700
He doesn't want anyone in his way.

264
00:32:12,368 --> 00:32:13,870
What?

265
00:32:13,870 --> 00:32:17,165
Who'd be in whose way?

266
00:32:17,165 --> 00:32:20,877
Don't start yelling at us!

267
00:32:21,502 --> 00:32:23,379
That's not what I meant.

268
00:32:26,549 --> 00:32:29,719
Kaoru! Why are you acting
like nothing's wrong?

269
00:32:30,887 --> 00:32:32,597
Kaoru!

270
00:32:33,514 --> 00:32:36,851
Of course she's upset, stupid!

271
00:32:39,812 --> 00:32:42,565
You too, Yahiko!

272
00:32:43,274 --> 00:32:44,567
Smarten up!

273
00:32:47,195 --> 00:32:49,697
You shut up!

274
00:32:49,697 --> 00:32:52,241
Damn it!

275
00:32:53,868 --> 00:32:56,579
Hey! Come back here!

276
00:33:07,590 --> 00:33:09,091
This is bullshit!

277
00:33:10,426 --> 00:33:12,136
Damn him!

278
00:33:13,596 --> 00:33:14,597
Damn it!

279
00:33:18,768 --> 00:33:20,144
What do you want?

280
00:33:21,646 --> 00:33:23,814
Battosai Himura.

281
00:33:25,107 --> 00:33:28,611
Word is there's someone
like him around here.

282
00:33:29,153 --> 00:33:32,949
There's no Battosai here.
Out of my way.

283
00:33:47,129 --> 00:33:48,130
Perfect!

284
00:33:49,173 --> 00:33:50,800
You want trouble?

285
00:33:51,342 --> 00:33:53,135
You found it.

286
00:33:53,135 --> 00:33:55,137
Where is Battosai?

287
00:33:55,846 --> 00:33:59,016
Take me and I'll tell you.

288
00:34:08,526 --> 00:34:10,194
Sanosuke!

289
00:34:17,702 --> 00:34:19,245
Sanosuke!

290
00:34:41,392 --> 00:34:45,187
Tell me before you pass out.

291
00:34:45,896 --> 00:34:48,065
Let me think...

292
00:35:08,085 --> 00:35:09,086
Stop it!

293
00:35:24,060 --> 00:35:25,603
Where is Battosai?

294
00:35:26,103 --> 00:35:27,605
Tell me!

295
00:35:29,565 --> 00:35:33,235
I'm just a passing doctor. I don't know.

296
00:35:49,126 --> 00:35:53,464
Odawara, on the Tokaido Highway

297
00:36:06,102 --> 00:36:07,561
He's got a sword!

298
00:36:07,561 --> 00:36:10,314
They were banned years ago!

299
00:37:00,698 --> 00:37:02,992
Battosai's passed Odawara.

300
00:37:04,243 --> 00:37:06,370
He'll come through the village.

301
00:37:06,370 --> 00:37:07,371
Probably.

302
00:37:13,335 --> 00:37:15,880
Let's arrange a welcome.

303
00:38:21,278 --> 00:38:23,280
Could I have my sword back?

304
00:38:27,284 --> 00:38:28,619
How?

305
00:38:28,619 --> 00:38:31,956
It's of no use to anyone but me.

306
00:38:31,956 --> 00:38:33,123
Yeah, sure!

307
00:38:33,624 --> 00:38:37,795
If you're still keeping it
now that swords are illegal,

308
00:38:38,671 --> 00:38:40,631
that means it's valuable.

309
00:39:02,403 --> 00:39:03,487
Hold it!

310
00:39:05,281 --> 00:39:06,949
Give me that!

311
00:39:06,949 --> 00:39:08,826
But it's my sword!

312
00:39:15,332 --> 00:39:17,334
Give it to me, I said!

313
00:39:37,354 --> 00:39:38,439
Wait!

314
00:39:41,066 --> 00:39:42,776
Please tell me

315
00:39:44,486 --> 00:39:45,696
why you want it.

316
00:39:57,499 --> 00:39:59,376
Excuse me.

317
00:40:02,004 --> 00:40:06,550
This sword is a back-blade.

318
00:40:09,345 --> 00:40:13,724
Only the back of the blade is sharp.

319
00:40:19,021 --> 00:40:22,733
So the front won't cut?

320
00:40:26,028 --> 00:40:27,905
My scabbard?

321
00:40:34,870 --> 00:40:36,246
I thank you.

322
00:40:37,039 --> 00:40:40,042
Who are you, anyway?

323
00:40:40,042 --> 00:40:42,544
I am a mere wanderer.

324
00:40:42,544 --> 00:40:45,255
Why is a girl stealing swords?

325
00:40:46,048 --> 00:40:49,051
To pay for a journey.

326
00:40:49,051 --> 00:40:51,637
That is no reason to steal.

327
00:40:51,637 --> 00:40:53,263
Keep your advice!

328
00:40:54,223 --> 00:40:55,265
Who's there?

329
00:41:04,733 --> 00:41:05,734
Help!

330
00:41:10,239 --> 00:41:12,074
Help!

331
00:41:12,074 --> 00:41:14,451
Help my brother!

332
00:41:15,828 --> 00:41:16,954
Brother!

333
00:41:21,166 --> 00:41:23,460
Brother!

334
00:41:29,258 --> 00:41:32,803
Save our village.

335
00:41:33,429 --> 00:41:35,305
What happened?

336
00:41:37,975 --> 00:41:44,148
I'm a constable.
I lost contact with my home village.

337
00:41:44,773 --> 00:41:48,819
I went to see what was wrong.

338
00:41:52,614 --> 00:41:55,993
Shishio found out who I was.

339
00:42:01,623 --> 00:42:03,167
Eiji.

340
00:42:04,126 --> 00:42:05,335
Brother!

341
00:42:11,675 --> 00:42:16,638
Take care of him, will you?

342
00:42:16,638 --> 00:42:17,681
Here's water.

343
00:42:22,019 --> 00:42:23,103
Brother!

344
00:42:24,980 --> 00:42:26,190
Brother!

345
00:42:27,691 --> 00:42:29,526
Brother!

346
00:42:30,360 --> 00:42:32,029
Brother!

347
00:42:40,996 --> 00:42:42,039
This way.

348
00:43:29,336 --> 00:43:30,546
Dad!

349
00:43:35,175 --> 00:43:36,468
Mom!

350
00:43:44,351 --> 00:43:47,771
Dad! Mom!

351
00:44:00,450 --> 00:44:01,827
Animals!

352
00:44:02,911 --> 00:44:04,413
Those animals!

353
00:44:08,125 --> 00:44:09,543
Dad!

354
00:44:09,543 --> 00:44:11,128
Mom!

355
00:44:19,303 --> 00:44:20,304
Animals!

356
00:44:21,555 --> 00:44:22,639
Animals!

357
00:44:22,639 --> 00:44:23,974
Dad!

358
00:44:24,808 --> 00:44:26,310
Mom!

359
00:44:40,073 --> 00:44:42,492
You killed my mom and dad!

360
00:44:42,492 --> 00:44:44,578
I'll kill you!

361
00:44:48,999 --> 00:44:50,417
Who are you?

362
00:44:53,837 --> 00:44:55,589
You want to die, too?

363
00:45:03,847 --> 00:45:06,183
Are you Shishio's men?

364
00:45:06,183 --> 00:45:07,851
What if we are?

365
00:45:09,019 --> 00:45:10,896
Why did you kill those two?

366
00:45:12,439 --> 00:45:18,195
Their son was going to tell the world
about this village.

367
00:45:20,113 --> 00:45:24,868
They took the blame.
The penalty is death.

368
00:45:25,827 --> 00:45:28,038
As an example?

369
00:45:34,294 --> 00:45:35,545
Watch the boy.

370
00:45:37,047 --> 00:45:38,382
Kill him!

371
00:47:07,804 --> 00:47:09,473
Let's bury them.

372
00:47:13,977 --> 00:47:14,978
Wait!

373
00:47:18,357 --> 00:47:19,816
Leave them.

374
00:47:21,651 --> 00:47:26,156
If we cut them down, we will anger Shishio.

375
00:47:26,990 --> 00:47:30,535
We'll be helpless before him.

376
00:47:31,036 --> 00:47:34,498
What are you talking about?
They're from your village!

377
00:47:35,082 --> 00:47:39,086
They should never have gone
against Shishio!

378
00:47:40,545 --> 00:47:42,339
No! Don't do it!

379
00:47:42,964 --> 00:47:44,174
Mom!

380
00:47:46,635 --> 00:47:48,678
Mom! Mom!

381
00:47:50,180 --> 00:47:51,431
Mom!

382
00:47:53,183 --> 00:47:54,518
Mom!

383
00:47:59,689 --> 00:48:02,192
Dad! Dad!

384
00:48:04,027 --> 00:48:07,197
Dad! Dad!

385
00:48:13,787 --> 00:48:16,373
Dad! Mom!

386
00:48:16,373 --> 00:48:19,626
So this is the world that Shishio wants...

387
00:48:37,853 --> 00:48:43,066
Very well done!
Taking all these men by yourself.

388
00:48:44,359 --> 00:48:45,902
So the stories are true,

389
00:48:46,862 --> 00:48:48,572
Battosai Himura.

390
00:48:50,365 --> 00:48:51,408
Himura?

391
00:48:53,201 --> 00:48:54,744
"Battosai?"

392
00:48:55,245 --> 00:48:57,080
Mr. Shishio calls.

393
00:49:16,099 --> 00:49:17,684
Mr. Shishio! Please!

394
00:49:37,746 --> 00:49:41,291
This sword deserves its reputation.

395
00:49:41,917 --> 00:49:43,293
It cuts.

396
00:49:52,302 --> 00:49:53,970
Your visitor is here.

397
00:50:05,774 --> 00:50:07,817
You're Shishio?

398
00:50:10,070 --> 00:50:15,325
At least say "mister,"
even if you had the job first.

399
00:50:17,619 --> 00:50:19,496
Why this village?

400
00:50:20,830 --> 00:50:26,836
You want the whole country,
not a few small places.

401
00:50:28,463 --> 00:50:31,800
The hot spring here is good for my skin.

402
00:50:32,425 --> 00:50:37,180
But without bandages, I scare people away.

403
00:50:38,807 --> 00:50:40,684
So to spare them that,

404
00:50:41,977 --> 00:50:44,187
I made the village mine.

405
00:50:45,981 --> 00:50:47,774
Damn you.

406
00:50:47,774 --> 00:50:51,653
Don't be mad. I'm just kidding.

407
00:50:51,653 --> 00:50:53,196
It's a joke.

408
00:50:54,322 --> 00:50:58,535
Is this revenge for what the government did?

409
00:51:00,161 --> 00:51:05,208
I don't care about revenge now.
Far from it. I'm grateful.

410
00:51:06,334 --> 00:51:09,504
My injuries taught me a lot.

411
00:51:09,504 --> 00:51:14,342
Trust, and you'll be betrayed.
Drop your guard, and you die.

412
00:51:14,342 --> 00:51:17,887
Kill first, before they kill you.

413
00:51:19,848 --> 00:51:23,727
The strong survive, and the weak die.

414
00:51:24,686 --> 00:51:27,230
Reality, plain and simple.

415
00:51:32,736 --> 00:51:35,071
I will make this country strong.

416
00:51:35,697 --> 00:51:39,242
That is the justice I will bring.

417
00:51:40,160 --> 00:51:41,536
Soon the whole land...

418
00:51:41,536 --> 00:51:44,914
It is not you who sheds blood for justice.

419
00:51:53,214 --> 00:51:55,592
Draw, Makoto Shishio.

420
00:51:57,761 --> 00:52:00,263
I won't allow any more bloodshed

421
00:52:02,057 --> 00:52:05,935
for this thing you call justice.

422
00:52:20,867 --> 00:52:24,746
Sojiro, play with him for me.

423
00:52:25,580 --> 00:52:26,748
May I?

424
00:52:30,251 --> 00:52:33,755
In that case, I don't mind if I do.

425
00:52:37,217 --> 00:52:39,094
What's that sword?

426
00:52:40,595 --> 00:52:41,930
I'm disappointed.

427
00:52:43,056 --> 00:52:48,103
I'll see you in Kyoto.
Come back as the real killer.

428
00:52:50,980 --> 00:52:52,440
You're running away?

429
00:52:53,441 --> 00:52:55,276
That's not nice.

430
00:52:55,944 --> 00:52:59,948
Stick around and let's play.
Mr. Shishio says we can.

431
00:53:36,985 --> 00:53:38,319
What's so funny?

432
00:53:39,362 --> 00:53:41,656
Nothing's funny.

433
00:53:41,656 --> 00:53:42,824
Nothing.

434
00:54:07,849 --> 00:54:10,351
It's a battle of technique.

435
00:54:15,523 --> 00:54:17,192
They're both equally fast.

436
00:54:18,234 --> 00:54:23,364
What will decide the outcome
is that one is happy to kill

437
00:54:24,699 --> 00:54:27,076
and one is not.

438
00:55:00,109 --> 00:55:03,279
Look what you did to this sword!

439
00:55:13,122 --> 00:55:18,461
Have a new sword ready
for the next time we meet.

440
00:56:23,318 --> 00:56:26,195
Now's your chance!

441
00:56:26,195 --> 00:56:30,366
Take revenge for your mother and father!

442
00:56:31,534 --> 00:56:32,702
No!

443
00:56:33,202 --> 00:56:35,538
Stop it!

444
00:56:41,836 --> 00:56:42,879
Kill them!

445
00:56:54,807 --> 00:56:58,895
You will please no one
by soiling those little hands.

446
00:57:03,066 --> 00:57:08,905
The dead wish only that the living be happy.

447
00:57:13,576 --> 00:57:16,579
In time, those little hands will grow big

448
00:57:18,039 --> 00:57:20,249
and you will be a man.

449
00:57:22,085 --> 00:57:28,257
Do not use your strength to oppress,
like those who serve Shishio.

450
00:57:30,593 --> 00:57:37,100
And do not let fear make you helpless,
like these people of the village.

451
00:57:41,270 --> 00:57:44,607
Be a man who guards his family to the last,

452
00:57:47,276 --> 00:57:50,113
like your brother.

453
00:58:43,332 --> 00:58:47,003
Look what he did
to a Kotetsu Nagasone sword.

454
00:58:49,797 --> 00:58:51,841
I underestimated him.

455
00:58:52,675 --> 00:58:55,344
"Kotetsu Nagasone?"

456
00:58:55,344 --> 00:58:58,181
A swordsman like you doesn't know him?

457
00:58:59,015 --> 00:59:04,520
Most people would give their eye teeth
to have a sword he made.

458
00:59:11,194 --> 00:59:12,195
That's good.

459
00:59:12,862 --> 00:59:14,530
Very good.

460
00:59:15,364 --> 00:59:16,365
Yes!

461
00:59:17,366 --> 00:59:19,702
Excellent!

462
00:59:21,204 --> 00:59:22,872
Welcome back, sir!

463
00:59:22,872 --> 00:59:25,208
Have you done what I wanted?

464
00:59:25,875 --> 00:59:28,711
We have all the weapons you asked for.

465
00:59:29,337 --> 00:59:30,379
Sojiro.

466
00:59:32,006 --> 00:59:33,549
Do something for me.

467
00:59:34,133 --> 00:59:36,552
Anything but pay for that sword.

468
00:59:36,552 --> 00:59:38,221
Summon the Ten Swords.

469
00:59:39,889 --> 00:59:41,057
What?

470
00:59:42,517 --> 00:59:45,228
You mean, at last?

471
00:59:47,396 --> 00:59:49,565
When they arrive,

472
00:59:54,904 --> 00:59:56,572
we go to war.

473
01:00:11,420 --> 01:00:12,922
I can't stand this.

474
01:00:14,924 --> 01:00:15,925
Stand what?

475
01:00:18,594 --> 01:00:20,429
Get down to Kyoto.

476
01:00:21,931 --> 01:00:23,766
Stop pretending.

477
01:00:26,602 --> 01:00:28,437
I'm not pretending.

478
01:00:30,773 --> 01:00:33,109
It is my opinion as a doctor

479
01:00:34,735 --> 01:00:38,781
that while everyone might think
Kenshin is invulnerable,

480
01:00:39,448 --> 01:00:44,453
I think he is a gifted athlete, but otherwise

481
01:00:45,288 --> 01:00:47,456
he's no different from us.

482
01:00:49,625 --> 01:00:53,296
Where one wound might easily heal

483
01:00:54,463 --> 01:00:56,966
multiple wounds add up.

484
01:00:58,801 --> 01:01:02,138
And Kenshin's battle hasn't only just begun.

485
01:01:03,472 --> 01:01:07,643
There's more than guns or swords
that could kill him.

486
01:01:16,986 --> 01:01:18,988
You'll regret it if you wait.

487
01:01:25,828 --> 01:01:26,996
I'm going.

488
01:01:27,997 --> 01:01:30,833
He'll face more than just Shishio.

489
01:01:33,669 --> 01:01:36,005
But you're still hurt!

490
01:01:36,005 --> 01:01:39,342
Quiet! I'll heal up on the road.

491
01:01:40,676 --> 01:01:42,178
I'll toughen up.

492
01:01:43,012 --> 01:01:44,180
Wait!

493
01:01:45,181 --> 01:01:47,016
Then take this.

494
01:01:50,186 --> 01:01:51,520
An elixir.

495
01:01:56,359 --> 01:01:59,528
An old family recipe. Take it once a day.

496
01:02:00,363 --> 01:02:01,530
And this.

497
01:02:02,865 --> 01:02:04,075
It's salve.

498
01:02:12,541 --> 01:02:15,086
Give Kenshin some, too.

499
01:02:17,546 --> 01:02:18,756
Thanks.

500
01:02:22,218 --> 01:02:23,219
But,

501
01:02:25,805 --> 01:02:27,765
you bring it.

502
01:02:30,226 --> 01:02:32,728
It's not my job to heal his wounds.

503
01:02:42,905 --> 01:02:43,906
Right!

504
01:02:44,573 --> 01:02:45,616
Right!

505
01:02:46,993 --> 01:02:48,077
I'm on my way!

506
01:03:08,597 --> 01:03:14,687
Kyoto

507
01:03:27,950 --> 01:03:29,785
Found you!

508
01:03:33,122 --> 01:03:34,957
I almost lost you!

509
01:03:36,625 --> 01:03:39,003
Have you got a place to stay?

510
01:03:39,795 --> 01:03:42,506
I know a good, cheap inn.

511
01:03:44,133 --> 01:03:46,344
-No, thank you.
-Wait, wait, wait!

512
01:03:46,969 --> 01:03:50,639
I'm Misao Makimachi.
I'm not a villain.

513
01:03:50,639 --> 01:03:51,682
Trust me.

514
01:03:52,475 --> 01:03:53,476
Come on!

515
01:04:05,988 --> 01:04:07,656
There it is!

516
01:04:07,656 --> 01:04:08,657
But...

517
01:04:10,826 --> 01:04:12,203
I'm back!

518
01:04:12,995 --> 01:04:14,497
Hey!

519
01:04:14,497 --> 01:04:16,499
A guest!

520
01:04:16,499 --> 01:04:17,833
Welcome!

521
01:04:17,833 --> 01:04:19,043
Elder?

522
01:04:21,420 --> 01:04:22,505
I'm back!

523
01:04:22,505 --> 01:04:24,006
Misao!

524
01:04:24,006 --> 01:04:25,257
Come here!

525
01:04:25,257 --> 01:04:26,675
I'll take your things.

526
01:04:27,510 --> 01:04:28,594
Don't be shy.

527
01:04:29,178 --> 01:04:30,179
But...

528
01:04:30,846 --> 01:04:32,848
He helped me out.

529
01:04:32,848 --> 01:04:35,184
Let him stay, all right?

530
01:04:35,184 --> 01:04:37,561
We'll charge through the nose!

531
01:04:38,854 --> 01:04:41,023
Just kidding!

532
01:04:41,023 --> 01:04:42,024
Hello.

533
01:04:43,192 --> 01:04:44,735
You're welcome here,

534
01:04:45,361 --> 01:04:47,571
Battosai Himura.

535
01:04:51,534 --> 01:04:52,576
Yes.

536
01:04:53,202 --> 01:04:55,246
The Battosai Himura

537
01:04:56,872 --> 01:04:58,707
Aoshi's looking for.

538
01:05:14,682 --> 01:05:15,766
Please...

539
01:05:16,892 --> 01:05:19,228
You've had a long journey.

540
01:05:19,228 --> 01:05:20,604
Thank you.

541
01:05:21,564 --> 01:05:26,944
It's been ten years since
you were in Kyoto, Battosai.

542
01:05:34,452 --> 01:05:37,496
I've always thought

543
01:05:37,496 --> 01:05:43,461
some day we would meet.

544
01:05:44,044 --> 01:05:47,381
I never thought it would be here, like this.

545
01:05:48,966 --> 01:05:50,050
You are?

546
01:05:50,551 --> 01:05:53,971
I am a ninja, one of the Hidden Watchers

547
01:05:54,680 --> 01:05:57,475
who was stationed with
the Kyoto Constabulary.

548
01:05:58,434 --> 01:06:00,436
So Miss Misao...

549
01:06:00,436 --> 01:06:01,645
Yes.

550
01:06:02,313 --> 01:06:07,151
The Shogunate assigned me
to gather information

551
01:06:07,776 --> 01:06:14,325
in the guise of an innkeeper,
as you see me now.

552
01:06:15,075 --> 01:06:18,245
When all of you brought down the Shogun,

553
01:06:19,121 --> 01:06:23,250
this became my living.

554
01:06:25,169 --> 01:06:28,672
But there were those among
the Shogun's servants

555
01:06:29,173 --> 01:06:34,136
for whom the transition was not so easy.

556
01:06:44,021 --> 01:06:49,985
One of the Watchers
stationed outside Edo Castle

557
01:06:49,985 --> 01:06:51,695
was Aoshi Shinomori.

558
01:06:58,369 --> 01:07:02,957
You remember the two sides agreed
Edo Castle would be surrendered

559
01:07:02,957 --> 01:07:08,379
and there would be no bloodshed
in Edo itself.

560
01:07:10,047 --> 01:07:13,175
Had that not happened,

561
01:07:13,175 --> 01:07:16,720
you would probably have encountered him.

562
01:07:17,555 --> 01:07:21,392
You were the two champions of each side.

563
01:07:24,395 --> 01:07:30,025
The Watchers were given
no opportunity to fight.

564
01:07:31,569 --> 01:07:33,696
And to make sure we wouldn't,
the Shogun's men...

565
01:07:39,451 --> 01:07:41,870
Why are you doing this to us?

566
01:07:46,417 --> 01:07:47,626
Intruder!

567
01:07:49,795 --> 01:07:54,341
Even though the new government
had offered him a post,

568
01:07:55,259 --> 01:08:00,347
Aoshi still tried to save his men
from death at the Shogun's hands.

569
01:08:04,685 --> 01:08:06,228
Captain!

570
01:08:09,148 --> 01:08:12,067
So the victors write the history?

571
01:08:13,986 --> 01:08:17,573
And we're flung into the dark?

572
01:08:17,573 --> 01:08:18,782
Ryujo!

573
01:08:18,782 --> 01:08:20,492
Shoot them!

574
01:08:22,411 --> 01:08:24,079
Captain! Live on!

575
01:08:26,832 --> 01:08:29,793
Long live the Watchers!

576
01:08:34,381 --> 01:08:38,302
Long may our name live!

577
01:08:46,769 --> 01:08:51,023
With no companions to preserve,
or Shogunate to hate,

578
01:08:52,149 --> 01:08:55,152
all of his anger and despair

579
01:08:55,152 --> 01:09:01,450
turned on Battosai Himura,
the greatest fighter of the age.

580
01:09:09,792 --> 01:09:12,002
He aims to kill you

581
01:09:12,670 --> 01:09:16,382
and, before the graves of his dead comrades,

582
01:09:16,382 --> 01:09:21,261
proclaim the Watchers as the mightiest of all.

583
01:09:23,931 --> 01:09:25,641
And Miss Misao?

584
01:09:26,975 --> 01:09:31,855
She doesn't know the demon he's become.

585
01:09:33,190 --> 01:09:36,694
She still pines for him.

586
01:09:42,408 --> 01:09:44,535
I understand.

587
01:09:45,327 --> 01:09:49,873
However, I have come to Kyoto

588
01:09:52,334 --> 01:09:55,212
to put an end to Shishio.

589
01:09:56,171 --> 01:09:57,548
I see.

590
01:10:00,217 --> 01:10:06,223
After ten years,
Battosai comes back to Kyoto.

591
01:10:08,058 --> 01:10:11,395
I knew there had to be a reason.

592
01:10:13,856 --> 01:10:19,403
The Hidden Watchers network
of informants remains in place.

593
01:10:20,070 --> 01:10:25,576
If you have need of us,
please do not hesitate to ask.

594
01:10:32,750 --> 01:10:34,460
I'll take you up on that.

595
01:10:36,086 --> 01:10:37,755
Yes?

596
01:10:37,755 --> 01:10:39,757
Could you find someone for me?

597
01:10:49,767 --> 01:10:51,935
The father of this sword,

598
01:10:53,437 --> 01:10:54,938
Shakku Arai.

599
01:10:57,775 --> 01:10:59,610
Let's find him right away.

600
01:11:25,636 --> 01:11:27,304
Excuse us.

601
01:11:27,304 --> 01:11:29,640
Another guest.

602
01:11:31,141 --> 01:11:33,644
Make yourself at home.

603
01:11:34,311 --> 01:11:35,479
You're here?

604
01:11:38,315 --> 01:11:40,818
Everyone knows who you are.

605
01:11:51,995 --> 01:11:54,998
Takano, Kyoto Police.

606
01:11:58,168 --> 01:12:00,337
These are Shishio's villages.

607
01:12:02,172 --> 01:12:05,175
The government has abandoned
about a dozen.

608
01:12:05,843 --> 01:12:08,512
They're under Shishio's control.

609
01:12:14,351 --> 01:12:16,144
Where's the army?

610
01:12:16,144 --> 01:12:17,646
They could fix this!

611
01:12:17,646 --> 01:12:18,647
I'm afraid

612
01:12:19,857 --> 01:12:26,530
we cannot afford to show weakness
in the face of the Western powers.

613
01:12:26,530 --> 01:12:29,199
They're just all afraid

614
01:12:29,199 --> 01:12:32,035
they'll end up like Okubo.

615
01:12:32,035 --> 01:12:34,371
Then what do we do?

616
01:12:34,371 --> 01:12:38,041
The way we're going,
we play right into Shishio's hands.

617
01:12:41,545 --> 01:12:47,217
That's exactly the reason we're all here now.

618
01:13:13,076 --> 01:13:14,077
Permission to enter!

619
01:13:18,081 --> 01:13:19,917
That was quick.

620
01:13:20,751 --> 01:13:23,420
I only live over in Osaka.

621
01:13:26,256 --> 01:13:30,427
Take it easy here till the others arrive.

622
01:13:31,595 --> 01:13:32,596
Yumi...

623
01:13:38,727 --> 01:13:39,811
So?

624
01:13:40,395 --> 01:13:42,898
Where's Battosai now?

625
01:13:43,440 --> 01:13:45,108
Kyoto, we think.

626
01:13:45,108 --> 01:13:49,613
Probably looking for a sword
to replace the one Sojiro broke.

627
01:13:50,614 --> 01:13:54,952
Battosai's sword would have come
from the best swordsmith.

628
01:13:55,535 --> 01:13:57,412
That means Shakku Arai.

629
01:13:57,412 --> 01:14:01,124
You can always depend on Cho
to know those things.

630
01:14:07,130 --> 01:14:10,300
Battosai's a bit of a fool, isn't he?

631
01:14:11,635 --> 01:14:14,972
Trying to get a dead man
to make him a sword.

632
01:14:32,322 --> 01:14:33,991
Shakku...

633
01:14:34,491 --> 01:14:37,661
Shakku Arai, d. 1870

634
01:14:38,161 --> 01:14:39,871
Himura!

635
01:14:42,124 --> 01:14:43,834
So you're going?

636
01:14:52,342 --> 01:14:55,846
Without killing anymore, I will try to preserve

637
01:14:56,346 --> 01:15:00,017
those who seek to bring about a new age.

638
01:15:02,686 --> 01:15:07,858
Well, if you find a way,
I sure hope you'll tell me.

639
01:15:12,863 --> 01:15:14,114
A farewell gift.

640
01:15:16,116 --> 01:15:19,369
Try being a swordsman
wearing one of those.

641
01:15:20,829 --> 01:15:25,709
Then you'll know
what you're saying is nonsense.

642
01:15:29,713 --> 01:15:30,964
The blade's

643
01:15:31,882 --> 01:15:33,133
on the back?

644
01:15:33,133 --> 01:15:38,555
If your head's still full
of that nonsense when it breaks,

645
01:15:39,222 --> 01:15:43,143
come back to Kyoto and find me again.

646
01:16:12,714 --> 01:16:14,925
Seiku! Someone's here.

647
01:16:16,968 --> 01:16:18,095
Coming.

648
01:16:22,390 --> 01:16:23,892
Can I help you?

649
01:16:24,726 --> 01:16:26,770
Mr. Seiku Arai?

650
01:16:27,437 --> 01:16:28,522
Yes.

651
01:16:29,022 --> 01:16:33,110
I owe your father a great debt of gratitude.

652
01:16:34,861 --> 01:16:38,949
Learning he has passed away,
I have come with a request.

653
01:16:41,284 --> 01:16:44,621
Could you please make me a sword?

654
01:16:51,795 --> 01:16:53,797
My father would often say

655
01:16:55,132 --> 01:16:58,468
how his swords would create a new age.

656
01:17:00,971 --> 01:17:07,144
But the truth is that
those swords took many lives.

657
01:17:14,317 --> 01:17:18,822
You can say it was the times,
and it had to be that way

658
01:17:20,323 --> 01:17:22,993
but this is the new age.

659
01:17:23,994 --> 01:17:26,329
Killing to change the world...

660
01:17:27,747 --> 01:17:32,502
The new age no longer requires
those weapons or that logic.

661
01:17:36,464 --> 01:17:41,178
Now I make kitchen knives
or things for everyday use.

662
01:17:43,930 --> 01:17:47,684
I'm sorry, but I will never make
another sword.

663
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:54,691
Very well.

664
01:17:56,526 --> 01:17:58,028
I'm sorry to bother you.

665
01:18:24,346 --> 01:18:26,890
Wow! So this is Kyoto!

666
01:18:33,980 --> 01:18:35,065
Hey!

667
01:18:35,065 --> 01:18:36,733
Stop leering!

668
01:18:36,733 --> 01:18:38,652
That hurt!

669
01:18:38,652 --> 01:18:41,571
Save that for when you grow up.

670
01:18:41,571 --> 01:18:42,989
I'm just looking!

671
01:18:42,989 --> 01:18:47,244
We're here to find Kenshin,
so get looking for him.

672
01:18:47,244 --> 01:18:48,912
Yeah, I know.

673
01:18:50,080 --> 01:18:53,750
Windmills for sale!

674
01:18:55,168 --> 01:18:59,089
Windmills! Come and get one!

675
01:18:59,589 --> 01:19:00,674
Look!

676
01:19:02,259 --> 01:19:06,346
Windmills! Windmills for sale!

677
01:19:20,610 --> 01:19:21,611
Hey!

678
01:19:23,571 --> 01:19:25,073
What are you doing?

679
01:19:25,073 --> 01:19:26,283
What's wrong?

680
01:19:28,910 --> 01:19:30,954
I'm just playing with him.

681
01:19:30,954 --> 01:19:32,122
What's the problem?

682
01:19:33,623 --> 01:19:35,292
He's got Iori!

683
01:19:41,965 --> 01:19:43,133
Who would you be?

684
01:19:44,467 --> 01:19:46,803
Do you wish something of me?

685
01:19:49,806 --> 01:19:52,767
You're Shakku Arai's son Seiku?

686
01:19:54,311 --> 01:19:56,479
Rumor has it

687
01:19:57,147 --> 01:20:00,483
that you've still got
the last sword your dad made.

688
01:20:01,651 --> 01:20:04,321
No one's ever used it, right?

689
01:20:07,824 --> 01:20:09,326
Can I see it?

690
01:20:20,587 --> 01:20:21,671
What's wrong?

691
01:20:21,671 --> 01:20:22,672
Mr. Himura!

692
01:20:23,256 --> 01:20:24,341
The police!

693
01:20:24,341 --> 01:20:26,009
Get the police!

694
01:20:26,009 --> 01:20:28,845
Our baby!

695
01:20:29,346 --> 01:20:32,015
Calm down, will you!

696
01:20:40,023 --> 01:20:42,359
Come on now! Don't cry!

697
01:20:43,193 --> 01:20:45,528
I'll shut you up soon enough.

698
01:20:57,874 --> 01:20:59,376
Who are you?

699
01:21:00,460 --> 01:21:02,045
Give back the child.

700
01:21:04,214 --> 01:21:08,051
Two scars crossed on your left cheek...

701
01:21:09,386 --> 01:21:11,721
So you're the famous killer,

702
01:21:12,514 --> 01:21:14,391
Battosai Himura?

703
01:21:17,060 --> 01:21:19,062
I hear your sword broke.

704
01:21:19,896 --> 01:21:23,900
So you're here for Shakku's last sword, too?

705
01:21:25,402 --> 01:21:26,736
What do you mean?

706
01:21:29,072 --> 01:21:32,909
You mean you don't care if I step in here?

707
01:21:32,909 --> 01:21:34,411
Then get lost.

708
01:21:35,078 --> 01:21:37,080
Give back the child.

709
01:21:38,248 --> 01:21:39,582
Why?

710
01:21:40,500 --> 01:21:45,422
If I get his last sword but I can't try it out,

711
01:21:46,756 --> 01:21:48,758
where's the fun in that?

712
01:22:32,427 --> 01:22:34,971
There's a fight going on!

713
01:22:34,971 --> 01:22:36,639
Fight!

714
01:22:36,639 --> 01:22:38,141
Call the police!

715
01:22:38,141 --> 01:22:40,643
Aw, just leave them.

716
01:22:41,144 --> 01:22:43,313
What's going on?

717
01:22:43,313 --> 01:22:46,399
Some ex-samurais are fighting
over in that shrine.

718
01:22:46,399 --> 01:22:48,485
You'd better keep away!

719
01:22:51,488 --> 01:22:52,489
Come on!

720
01:22:56,743 --> 01:22:58,161
Draw your damn sword!

721
01:23:13,801 --> 01:23:16,012
You're good, I'll give you that.

722
01:23:16,930 --> 01:23:20,683
But this prize is going to cost you!

723
01:23:38,326 --> 01:23:39,827
Iori!

724
01:23:39,827 --> 01:23:40,828
Stay back!

725
01:23:44,666 --> 01:23:46,042
Are we done?

726
01:23:47,377 --> 01:23:50,880
You're going to risk your life
just to save one kid?

727
01:24:06,896 --> 01:24:09,566
What's that look?

728
01:24:10,567 --> 01:24:12,735
You're pissing me off!

729
01:24:14,404 --> 01:24:16,406
I killed many

730
01:24:18,366 --> 01:24:21,327
to bring about a new age.

731
01:24:23,246 --> 01:24:24,914
Are you bragging?

732
01:24:25,415 --> 01:24:27,250
Be my guest.

733
01:24:27,250 --> 01:24:31,254
Go ahead and cling to
the glories of the past.

734
01:24:32,422 --> 01:24:34,424
What a loser!

735
01:24:34,424 --> 01:24:39,262
Ten years since struggle and blood
brought us to a new age.

736
01:24:40,263 --> 01:24:45,268
Now, in a happy home
that knows nothing of war,

737
01:24:47,437 --> 01:24:51,941
we begin to see a time of peace
in which to raise its children.

738
01:24:53,943 --> 01:25:00,450
Think what you will, but that child
is the blessing of the new age.

739
01:25:14,964 --> 01:25:17,634
If it costs me my life,

740
01:25:21,638 --> 01:25:23,973
I will take him back.

741
01:25:34,150 --> 01:25:36,486
A real hero of justice, huh?

742
01:25:42,116 --> 01:25:44,661
My father's last killing swords!

743
01:26:06,974 --> 01:26:10,019
Wait, Iori! Just a little bit longer!

744
01:26:21,364 --> 01:26:22,532
I'll take the chance!

745
01:26:23,199 --> 01:26:26,369
If anyone can put that sword
to good use, it's him!

746
01:27:03,740 --> 01:27:06,409
Father! Watch over us!

747
01:27:35,062 --> 01:27:36,189
Damn you!

748
01:28:23,152 --> 01:28:24,403
Kenshin!

749
01:28:24,403 --> 01:28:25,822
That hurt!

750
01:28:27,448 --> 01:28:28,825
Who's that?

751
01:28:28,825 --> 01:28:29,992
Where's his sword?

752
01:28:33,663 --> 01:28:35,998
Mr. Himura! Take this!

753
01:28:50,096 --> 01:28:54,016
It's my father's last sword! Use it!

754
01:28:56,853 --> 01:28:59,021
So there was one!

755
01:28:59,856 --> 01:29:01,858
That sword will be mine!

756
01:29:06,445 --> 01:29:07,488
Draw.

757
01:29:08,364 --> 01:29:13,035
We'll have a real fight. Let's see who wins.

758
01:29:22,211 --> 01:29:27,049
Well? You're Battosai the Killer, aren't you?

759
01:29:28,050 --> 01:29:31,387
My sword's out. Where's yours?

760
01:29:35,391 --> 01:29:39,228
Fine! If you've forgotten
how good killing feels.

761
01:29:39,896 --> 01:29:41,898
I'll remind you.

762
01:29:42,815 --> 01:29:44,901
I'll do one right now!

763
01:29:44,901 --> 01:29:45,902
Iori!

764
01:29:46,569 --> 01:29:47,737
Iori!

765
01:29:48,237 --> 01:29:49,572
Wait there.

766
01:29:50,072 --> 01:29:52,742
I'll cut you into pieces.

767
01:29:54,911 --> 01:29:56,662
No killing!

768
01:30:08,215 --> 01:30:09,592
You know,

769
01:30:11,594 --> 01:30:13,930
you're really good.

770
01:30:18,434 --> 01:30:19,602
Iori!

771
01:30:20,269 --> 01:30:22,271
Iori!

772
01:30:24,106 --> 01:30:25,608
Iori!

773
01:30:30,363 --> 01:30:31,530
Kenshin...

774
01:30:39,288 --> 01:30:40,581
Kenshin?

775
01:30:55,429 --> 01:30:56,639
He's not dead.

776
01:30:56,639 --> 01:31:00,309
Kaoru! He didn't kill him!

777
01:31:00,309 --> 01:31:01,978
That's a back-blade.

778
01:31:13,990 --> 01:31:15,491
I'm glad!

779
01:31:21,205 --> 01:31:22,331
Iori!

780
01:31:27,003 --> 01:31:28,170
Iori!

781
01:31:29,171 --> 01:31:30,506
Iori!

782
01:31:32,341 --> 01:31:33,509
He's fine!

783
01:31:36,012 --> 01:31:37,179
On your feet!

784
01:31:38,597 --> 01:31:39,682
Get him up!

785
01:31:42,268 --> 01:31:43,602
Bring him!

786
01:31:46,564 --> 01:31:47,690
Walk!

787
01:31:48,441 --> 01:31:51,527
Kenshin! Are you okay?

788
01:31:52,737 --> 01:31:55,531
Is that a new back-blade?

789
01:31:56,574 --> 01:31:57,575
Hey...

790
01:32:01,037 --> 01:32:03,039
Hey, Kenshin...

791
01:32:06,792 --> 01:32:08,085
Kenshin...

792
01:33:20,783 --> 01:33:22,034
Seiku,

793
01:33:24,495 --> 01:33:25,871
what's this?

794
01:33:31,127 --> 01:33:33,295
The true back-blade.

795
01:33:35,172 --> 01:33:37,466
"True?"

796
01:33:39,969 --> 01:33:42,847
The sword he made for the gods

797
01:33:44,306 --> 01:33:47,685
out of remorse, mixed with a tiny bit of hope.

798
01:33:50,646 --> 01:33:55,151
When you dedicate a sword
to the gods, you forge two.

799
01:33:56,652 --> 01:33:59,697
The better one is "true."
You give that to the gods.

800
01:34:00,614 --> 01:34:06,495
The other one is the "shadow."
You let someone else have that.

801
01:34:07,496 --> 01:34:08,497
So...

802
01:34:10,875 --> 01:34:11,876
Yes.

803
01:34:13,335 --> 01:34:18,507
The one he gave you was the shadow.

804
01:34:24,555 --> 01:34:29,018
Have that sword.

805
01:34:33,230 --> 01:34:35,357
Father would have wanted that.

806
01:34:51,707 --> 01:34:56,086
"Reluctantly, for years,
I have tempered swords.

807
01:34:57,671 --> 01:35:01,425
"Not for the world of my son,
but to bring peace for his child."

808
01:35:06,722 --> 01:35:08,766
Kenshin, I'm coming in.

809
01:35:12,937 --> 01:35:14,897
Did you rest?

810
01:35:15,606 --> 01:35:16,815
Yeah.

811
01:35:16,815 --> 01:35:18,317
Right, Kaoru?

812
01:35:24,615 --> 01:35:25,783
Are you angry?

813
01:35:29,453 --> 01:35:32,456
About me following you to Kyoto?

814
01:35:35,793 --> 01:35:36,961
Half.

815
01:35:38,712 --> 01:35:40,256
The other half

816
01:35:43,425 --> 01:35:44,635
relieved.

817
01:35:48,889 --> 01:35:51,475
Shishio's men are everywhere.

818
01:35:53,435 --> 01:35:55,437
Be very careful.

819
01:35:58,649 --> 01:36:01,277
See? I told you.

820
01:36:01,986 --> 01:36:06,532
When a woman follows a man,
he acts like she's a pest,

821
01:36:06,532 --> 01:36:09,994
but he's still happy about it.

822
01:36:09,994 --> 01:36:13,956
You be quiet. You don't know
what you're talking about.

823
01:36:28,137 --> 01:36:29,680
Shakku,

824
01:36:30,848 --> 01:36:36,645
I'm just like you.
My head's still full of nonsense.

825
01:36:40,316 --> 01:36:42,026
Thanks for coming out!

826
01:36:42,818 --> 01:36:44,820
I greet the Ten Swords!

827
01:36:45,988 --> 01:36:47,156
Hoji!

828
01:36:47,156 --> 01:36:48,532
Take charge.

829
01:36:57,166 --> 01:37:00,711
Tomorrow, at one minute to midnight,

830
01:37:02,129 --> 01:37:04,715
we make Kyoto an inferno!

831
01:37:13,474 --> 01:37:18,145
You hear that, comrades?
The time has come at last!

832
01:37:18,687 --> 01:37:21,899
Those lazy fools will feel

833
01:37:21,899 --> 01:37:23,942
our power to the full!

834
01:38:11,949 --> 01:38:14,284
You're Cho the Sword Hunter,

835
01:38:15,327 --> 01:38:17,413
one of Shishio's Ten Swords.

836
01:38:17,413 --> 01:38:18,789
Are you not?

837
01:38:22,126 --> 01:38:24,294
So what's the big deal?

838
01:38:25,337 --> 01:38:27,005
What's he planning?

839
01:38:41,770 --> 01:38:44,648
Tell us and it'll go easier on you.

840
01:38:47,651 --> 01:38:51,321
It's time to stop being loyal to Shishio.

841
01:38:54,825 --> 01:39:00,831
What are you talking about?
I'm not loyal to Shishio.

842
01:39:02,374 --> 01:39:05,419
He was just a way to get where I wanted.

843
01:39:23,479 --> 01:39:25,689
The guy you beat up talked.

844
01:39:27,816 --> 01:39:29,526
Shishio's burning Kyoto.

845
01:39:31,487 --> 01:39:33,363
That's been planned before.

846
01:39:34,364 --> 01:39:40,037
In the days of the Shogun,
when we raided the Ikedaya.

847
01:39:40,913 --> 01:39:43,999
We were in time to stop them.

848
01:39:43,999 --> 01:39:47,336
And Shishio wants to
try the same thing again?

849
01:39:47,336 --> 01:39:52,549
Probably to prove that this government
can't stop them now.

850
01:39:53,675 --> 01:39:59,223
But why would Cho just tell you
something that important?

851
01:40:00,516 --> 01:40:06,855
They're a bunch of hoodlums.
There's always one who'll talk.

852
01:40:06,855 --> 01:40:10,901
It's set for tomorrow
at one minute to midnight.

853
01:40:41,765 --> 01:40:45,936
Shishio is plotting something
for the night of the waning moon.

854
01:40:47,229 --> 01:40:48,939
Sniff the wind.

855
01:40:51,066 --> 01:40:53,610
Kyoto, a sea of fire?

856
01:40:54,903 --> 01:40:56,446
If we allow it,

857
01:40:57,239 --> 01:40:59,283
many will die.

858
01:41:01,243 --> 01:41:05,289
We have deep roots here in Kyoto.

859
01:41:05,789 --> 01:41:08,458
He won't get away with it.

860
01:41:08,458 --> 01:41:11,253
Misao, send pigeons.

861
01:41:11,253 --> 01:41:12,671
Tell all Kyoto.

862
01:41:12,671 --> 01:41:13,755
I will.

863
01:41:13,755 --> 01:41:15,340
Kurojo, Shirojo,

864
01:41:15,340 --> 01:41:16,967
Masugami, Omime.

865
01:41:17,968 --> 01:41:19,970
Dress for action.

866
01:41:22,764 --> 01:41:26,810
We'll show them what
the Hidden Watchers can do!

867
01:41:44,119 --> 01:41:45,662
The north side!

868
01:42:14,024 --> 01:42:15,692
Stay in your homes!

869
01:42:17,486 --> 01:42:20,614
Martial Law is declared for all of Kyoto!

870
01:43:56,418 --> 01:43:57,461
Kenshin!

871
01:44:01,298 --> 01:44:02,591
We'll fight, too.

872
01:44:04,301 --> 01:44:05,635
But...

873
01:44:05,635 --> 01:44:08,138
I made up my mind before I came.

874
01:44:09,556 --> 01:44:12,434
I'll see this through to the end.

875
01:44:12,434 --> 01:44:15,771
Me, too. You can see what I've learned.

876
01:44:20,442 --> 01:44:21,485
Let's go.

877
01:44:24,613 --> 01:44:26,490
Don't try too much.

878
01:44:32,496 --> 01:44:33,747
Stay with them.

879
01:44:37,667 --> 01:44:39,669
This is a fight to the death.

880
01:44:41,338 --> 01:44:44,174
A fencing instructor won't help.

881
01:44:55,560 --> 01:44:58,438
Come and fight with us.

882
01:44:59,606 --> 01:45:00,607
Let's go.

883
01:45:16,665 --> 01:45:17,833
They're here.

884
01:45:30,554 --> 01:45:32,222
Take your positions.

885
01:45:46,152 --> 01:45:47,237
Sojiro.

886
01:45:48,071 --> 01:45:49,072
Yes?

887
01:45:50,240 --> 01:45:51,908
Remember my souvenir.

888
01:45:53,827 --> 01:45:54,828
I will.

889
01:46:05,755 --> 01:46:08,091
Set them off.

890
01:46:08,592 --> 01:46:09,759
Yes, sir.

891
01:47:50,819 --> 01:47:54,030
Everybody, be on your guard.

892
01:48:38,074 --> 01:48:40,076
Riflemen, forward!

893
01:48:49,252 --> 01:48:53,381
On your honor as police officers,
stop them in their tracks!

894
01:48:53,882 --> 01:48:55,175
All right!

895
01:48:59,262 --> 01:49:00,764
Burn the place!

896
01:49:02,515 --> 01:49:03,600
Fire!

897
01:49:15,278 --> 01:49:16,738
Police!

898
01:49:16,738 --> 01:49:18,406
Kill!

899
01:49:18,948 --> 01:49:20,283
Fire!

900
01:49:22,285 --> 01:49:23,369
Men!

901
01:49:23,369 --> 01:49:24,370
Charge!

902
01:51:26,659 --> 01:51:28,244
You're getting better.

903
01:51:28,244 --> 01:51:31,164
I am Yahiko Myojin, samurai of Tokyo!

904
01:51:38,421 --> 01:51:40,715
Bring fire!

905
01:51:40,715 --> 01:51:43,009
We know what you're planning!

906
01:51:57,232 --> 01:52:01,611
Thanks for coming out this late at night!

907
01:52:02,403 --> 01:52:06,449
Street-fightin' Sanosuke's in town!

908
01:52:36,562 --> 01:52:38,273
He's back.

909
01:52:40,233 --> 01:52:41,567
Go on ahead.

910
01:52:57,625 --> 01:52:59,294
Where's Battosai?

911
01:53:01,754 --> 01:53:06,509
I heard you're sheltering a man
with crossed scars on his cheek.

912
01:53:08,970 --> 01:53:15,184
You know how hard
Misao's been looking for you?

913
01:53:16,185 --> 01:53:20,815
She still believes
you're the man you always were.

914
01:53:20,815 --> 01:53:22,692
That is of no concern.

915
01:53:23,651 --> 01:53:28,364
He is a valued guest here at the Aoiya.

916
01:53:31,659 --> 01:53:34,620
Hiding in plain sight, is he?

917
01:53:34,620 --> 01:53:37,874
Open your eyes, Aoshi.

918
01:53:39,625 --> 01:53:42,503
What you need is not battle.

919
01:53:43,963 --> 01:53:46,466
Calm your heart.

920
01:53:47,133 --> 01:53:49,010
The Shogunate lives!

921
01:54:29,509 --> 01:54:35,515
If you have abandoned
your honor as a Watcher

922
01:54:35,515 --> 01:54:39,268
to tread the path of blood and carnage...

923
01:54:53,282 --> 01:54:56,744
I will crush you!

924
01:55:41,789 --> 01:55:43,124
Burn!

925
01:55:51,799 --> 01:55:53,176
No! No!

926
01:55:54,177 --> 01:55:55,470
Don't kill!

927
01:55:56,095 --> 01:55:57,472
Don't kill.

928
01:56:03,269 --> 01:56:04,312
Are you okay?

929
01:56:25,958 --> 01:56:28,044
Fire! Put it out!

930
01:56:34,300 --> 01:56:35,551
We'll take over here.

931
01:56:36,219 --> 01:56:37,303
Please.

932
01:56:42,558 --> 01:56:43,893
Hold still.

933
01:57:01,244 --> 01:57:02,662
Shishio!

934
01:57:24,267 --> 01:57:25,351
Decoys.

935
01:58:17,320 --> 01:58:18,988
Kenshin!

936
01:58:20,156 --> 01:58:21,157
Where are you?

937
01:58:25,328 --> 01:58:26,996
Wait for me!

938
01:58:37,673 --> 01:58:40,676
Give me a fight, damn it!

939
01:58:42,011 --> 01:58:43,679
Misao!

940
01:58:44,930 --> 01:58:46,015
What?

941
01:58:46,015 --> 01:58:48,351
It's Elder and Aoshi!

942
01:58:48,851 --> 01:58:50,686
Aoshi's come back?

943
01:59:22,051 --> 01:59:23,886
Where's Battosai?

944
01:59:34,689 --> 01:59:36,565
That again?

945
02:00:11,434 --> 02:00:13,102
Aoshi!

946
02:00:13,102 --> 02:00:14,270
Stay back!

947
02:00:35,291 --> 02:00:36,792
Damn you, Aoshi.

948
02:00:41,297 --> 02:00:42,965
Is that how low

949
02:00:43,799 --> 02:00:48,137
you've sunk?

950
02:01:28,260 --> 02:01:31,138
I am not the Aoshi you once knew.

951
02:02:28,946 --> 02:02:29,947
Hey!

952
02:02:31,699 --> 02:02:35,077
All you underlings, get outta here!

953
02:02:45,754 --> 02:02:46,922
Sanosuke?

954
02:02:47,590 --> 02:02:48,757
Why are you here?

955
02:02:52,553 --> 02:02:53,596
"Why?"

956
02:02:54,555 --> 02:02:57,766
To help you out, stupid!

957
02:03:04,398 --> 02:03:05,774
Thank you.

958
02:03:11,906 --> 02:03:13,449
All right, then.

959
02:03:14,241 --> 02:03:16,827
Victory is ours!

960
02:03:16,827 --> 02:03:17,828
Who are they?

961
02:03:19,663 --> 02:03:20,956
Get them all!

962
02:03:23,250 --> 02:03:24,752
Himura!

963
02:03:24,752 --> 02:03:26,128
You again?

964
02:03:26,128 --> 02:03:28,422
Something's wrong here.

965
02:03:28,422 --> 02:03:29,924
Yes.

966
02:03:29,924 --> 02:03:32,760
Where's Shishio and his Ten Swords?

967
02:03:32,760 --> 02:03:35,596
Why are you two looking so down?

968
02:03:35,596 --> 02:03:38,307
It's all been too easy.

969
02:03:39,600 --> 02:03:45,314
If he meant to burn Kyoto,
he'd be here to see it himself.

970
02:04:09,630 --> 02:04:12,007
Miss Kaoru Kamiya?

971
02:04:13,467 --> 02:04:14,510
Who are you?

972
02:04:17,346 --> 02:04:20,683
You mean Shishio's got
something else up his sleeve?

973
02:04:22,476 --> 02:04:28,482
At the Battle of Toba-Fushimi,
when the Shogun and the Emperor

974
02:04:28,482 --> 02:04:31,986
battled for rule over the land,

975
02:04:31,986 --> 02:04:37,866
Shogun Yoshinobu abandoned
his forces and fled by ship to Edo.

976
02:04:43,998 --> 02:04:48,043
Without that, the new government
never would have won.

977
02:04:48,836 --> 02:04:50,504
History changed course.

978
02:04:50,504 --> 02:04:56,343
If he can rewrite history,
he'll terrify the government.

979
02:04:56,343 --> 02:04:58,303
By spitting in their eye?

980
02:04:58,303 --> 02:05:01,056
Burning Kyoto is a first step.

981
02:05:01,849 --> 02:05:04,226
If he wants to retrace history...

982
02:05:06,020 --> 02:05:07,396
Just maybe...

983
02:05:10,190 --> 02:05:12,234
I'm going to bombard Tokyo

984
02:05:17,698 --> 02:05:20,409
and destroy the country!

985
02:05:23,704 --> 02:05:25,914
His real aim is Tokyo!

986
02:05:26,832 --> 02:05:27,833
Kenshin!

987
02:05:37,217 --> 02:05:38,761
Miss Kaoru!

988
02:06:14,004 --> 02:06:15,464
Where are you?

989
02:06:20,427 --> 02:06:21,804
Where are you?

990
02:06:24,264 --> 02:06:26,475
Where are you, Battosai?

991
02:06:29,269 --> 02:06:30,479
Where?

992
02:06:32,773 --> 02:06:34,316
Where?

993
02:06:35,943 --> 02:06:37,986
Battosai!

994
02:07:28,662 --> 02:07:29,663
Who are you?

995
02:07:41,008 --> 02:07:42,050
Stop!

996
02:07:51,351 --> 02:07:53,061
Well done!

997
02:07:54,021 --> 02:07:56,899
You saw that Kyoto was just a feint.

998
02:07:57,524 --> 02:07:59,276
Where's Miss Kaoru?

999
02:07:59,276 --> 02:08:03,113
What, you mean you're only here
for a woman?

1000
02:08:03,113 --> 02:08:05,574
Leave her out of this!

1001
02:08:06,200 --> 02:08:07,576
Whatever.

1002
02:08:08,702 --> 02:08:10,746
Miss Kaoru, you're on!

1003
02:08:14,958 --> 02:08:16,043
Miss Kaoru!

1004
02:08:16,043 --> 02:08:20,130
Come on, Yumi! Untie the poor girl.

1005
02:08:20,130 --> 02:08:21,256
Sure.

1006
02:08:22,299 --> 02:08:24,218
Have no fear! I will...

1007
02:08:24,218 --> 02:08:27,596
Stop talking like a damn samurai!

1008
02:08:30,891 --> 02:08:36,396
I want to see that killing spirit of yours.

1009
02:08:36,396 --> 02:08:39,107
It's me you want. Let her go.

1010
02:08:40,901 --> 02:08:42,945
This is the perfect chance

1011
02:08:43,487 --> 02:08:48,450
to see once and for all who's the best.

1012
02:08:53,747 --> 02:08:55,082
Kenshin!

1013
02:08:55,082 --> 02:08:56,124
Hoji!

1014
02:08:56,708 --> 02:08:58,669
I'll burn her!

1015
02:08:58,669 --> 02:08:59,753
No!

1016
02:08:59,753 --> 02:09:04,007
It hurts when you burn.
So much you want to die.

1017
02:09:04,007 --> 02:09:05,259
No.

1018
02:09:05,259 --> 02:09:07,261
Yes!

1019
02:09:07,261 --> 02:09:09,972
It's that rage I want to see!

1020
02:09:11,265 --> 02:09:14,768
You want to kill me, right?

1021
02:09:14,768 --> 02:09:15,852
Try it.

1022
02:09:15,852 --> 02:09:16,937
Shut up.

1023
02:09:16,937 --> 02:09:20,107
No! Don't let him tempt you!

1024
02:09:20,107 --> 02:09:24,111
Curse yourself, curse the gods.

1025
02:09:24,111 --> 02:09:27,948
Curse Buddha, hate the times,
hate everything.

1026
02:09:27,948 --> 02:09:29,032
No!

1027
02:09:29,032 --> 02:09:31,243
Now you're looking good.

1028
02:09:37,457 --> 02:09:40,335
Shishio!

1029
02:09:45,132 --> 02:09:46,341
Kenshin!

1030
02:09:52,264 --> 02:09:53,348
Miss Kaoru!

1031
02:09:53,348 --> 02:09:56,059
Stay alive!

1032
02:10:02,649 --> 02:10:05,319
Watch, Battosai!

1033
02:10:19,374 --> 02:10:21,668
Is that all you got?

1034
02:10:21,668 --> 02:10:24,379
Can't the legendary Battosai
do better than that?

1035
02:10:36,850 --> 02:10:38,226
What?

1036
02:10:40,020 --> 02:10:43,565
The legend just wants to play love-suicides?

1037
02:10:47,027 --> 02:10:48,236
Miss Kaoru!

1038
02:10:48,862 --> 02:10:50,405
Miss Kaoru!

1039
02:10:52,199 --> 02:10:53,575
Miss Kaoru!
